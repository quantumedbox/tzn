—- Design —-
  After you catch yourself on a thought "i would like to have something"
  Immediately ask yourself "is it easy to implement?"
  Then "is it even necessary for current problem?"
  And finally "is there already a way to do this?"

  Don't seek complexity, seek simplicity
  Explicit is better than implicit, unless it's totally obvious

- Follow C 89/90 guidelines as strictly as possible
- Respect the SEI CERT C Coding Standard!
- Prefix every source with "tzn" and suffix with ".h" or ".c" 
- All source / header files should have names with 8 symbols at most, which leaves 3 symbols after "tzn" prefix and file extension
  Even though 89/90 guidelines specify that identifiers could be at least 31 characters in isn't the fact on pre 89/90 compilers
  Because of that all identifier should have 8 characters at most which leaves 4 to 5 significant chars after "tzn" or "TZN_" prefix
- Always check nullity of function pointers by "if (ptr)", not with TZN_NULL

- Respect styling:
  - All variables, macro and function definitions should have comment explaining what their name abbreviates
  - Each indentation level is signaled by 2 spaces
  - Macros identifiers in style of "TZN_MCRO"
  - Functions identifiers in style of "tznMyFun"
  - External variables in style of "tznMyVar"
  - Internal, auto variables, and function arguments in style of "my_var"
  - Enums should not end with comma

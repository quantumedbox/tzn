- Follow C 89/90 guidelines as strictly as possible:
  - Prefix every source with "tzn" and suffix with ".h" or ".c" 
  - All source / header files should have names with 8 symbols at most, which leaves 3 symbols after "tzn" prefix and file extension
  - Always check nullity of function pointers by "if (ptr)", not with TZN_NULL

- Archaic C:
  - Even though 89/90 guidelines specify that identifiers could be at least 63 characters in isn't the fact on all pre 89/90 compilers
    Because of that all identifier should have 8 characters at most which leaves 4 to 5 significant chars after "tzn" or "TZN_" prefix

- Respect the SEI CERT C Coding Standard!

- Style:
  - All variables, macro and function definitions should have comment explaining what their name abbreviates
  - Each indentation level is signaled by 2 spaces
  - Macros identifiers in style of "TZN_MCRO"
  - Functions identifiers in style of "tznMyFun"
  - External variables in style of "tznMyVar"
  - Internal, auto variables, and function arguments in style of "my_var"
  - Enums should not end with comma

Follow C 89/90 guidelines as strictly as possible:
  -- Prefix every source with "tzn" and suffix with ".h" or ".c" 
  -- All source / header files should have names with 8 symbols at most, which leaves 3 symbols after "tzn" prefix and file extension

Respect SEI CERT C Coding Standard!

Style:
  -- Each indentation level is signaled by 2 spaces
